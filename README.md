# Java Programming

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course **Advanced Programming Techniques**.

There is a `lab` folder per each university assignment.
Each `lab` folder contains both code and an explanation document, either directly as a markdown file, or nested in a `doc` folder.
Assignments 2 through 5 are in *Russian*.

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!
